Poke Tacos
                    
Ingredients

For the Poke:
1 Pound Tuna (Ahi, Blue Fin, or Yellow Fin)
2 Tbsp Sesame Oil
1 Clove Garlic Grated
½ tbsp grated ginger
1 cup chopped green onions
1 tbsp sriracha (more if you like it spicy)
1 tbsp soy sauce
1 sweet onion
1 tbsp sesame seeds (I like a mix between black and white)

For the taco shells:
12 Round wonton wrappers
3-4 cups canola or vegetable oil

For the Wasabi Aioli
½ a cup of Japanese Mayonnaise 
⅛ cup of sriracha
1 tsp of sesame oil
2 tsp of wasabi powder (more if you want more kick)


1. Roughly chop sweet onion and green onions. Traditional Poke calls for sliced onions but in order to fit in the taco shells we’ll do a rough chop. Grate garlic and ginger and mix in a bowl with the onions and sesame seeds. Add the soy sauce and mix thoroughly, set aside for now. 

2. Grab your Tuna and cut in roughly ½ inch cubes, add to the bowl and mix in your sesame oil and sriracha. Salt to taste. Leave your poke in the fridge for a few hours to soak in all the flavor.

3. Heat your oil in a deep pan to 375 degrees F. Add one wonton wrapper at a time. Once you place the wrapper in the hot oil it will flare up quickly. Once it folds back down, use a cannoli pipe and tongs to press down on the wrapper in the oil so it folds back up and shapes around the cannoli pipe. After about 30 seconds the fold should stay. Flip the taco shell and fry the other side. Fry all sides until golden brown, make sure the opening is large enough to hold a good amount of poke. Place on a cooling rack to let the oil drain and cool. Repeat until you have enough shells. 

4. To plate I like to put a dollop of guacamole on a plate, then prop the taco up on the guacamole. Mix ingredients for wasabi aioli and drizzle on tacos.
